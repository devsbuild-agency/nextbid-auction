# Rest_api_Php
building my own Api from scratch 

The aim of the project is to create a distributed system that uses REST API for communication between system components in any technology (i used PHP). 

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: 

The online auction system should enable users to list and bid on items in various categories. All data should be stored in a permanent manner (XML, database). When designing and implementing, the MVC or equivalent model must be strictly adhered to. 

 

1. Create a REST API that allows you to support users: 

a. Adding a user 

b. Editing a user 

c. Deleting a User 

d. Retrieving user information 

2. Create a REST API that allows you to handle auctions: 

a. Adding an item to an auction 

b. Editing an item for bidding 

c. Removing an item from the auction 

d. Downloading information about the item at the auction 

3. Create a REST API that will allow you to make a payment for the auctioned item - in this case, use the sanbox of the selected payment operator 

4. Create an interface that allows you to conduct auctions in the selected technology
